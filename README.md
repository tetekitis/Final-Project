Narrative:
Cleo is an up and coming entrepreneur and is always tied up in either meeting, phone calls or conversations with potential clients. Cleo needs the ability to quickly access her notepad and rapidly insert notes with ease. She needs access to a clean user-friendly web application that is distinct with a call to action buttons. Cleo doesn't want to waste time formatting and wants her notepad to do all the formatting. Cleo is also short on time and in between meetings she relies on her notes and requires a way to visually tell which notes are most important.
